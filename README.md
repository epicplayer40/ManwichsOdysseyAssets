# Manwich's Odyssey Raw Assets
This is the updated branch of uncompiled assets that has been seperated from the mod base to reduce the total size.

# Upload Specifications
Uncompiled model files should be uploaded in their own folder in modelsrc (along with associated custom textures for the model). Raw texture files (not VTF or VMT) that are not associated with any custom models are to be placed in materialsrc and their file path should resemble how they are organised in the mod itself. If you are still unsure how you should organise your files then look at existing examples in this repo (or just ask someone).

# Upload Credits
If you are uploading someone else's files, be sure to credit them in some form. Either a .txt file that is uploaded alongside your sources or as a comment in a model's QC file will do.
